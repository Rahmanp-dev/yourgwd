# Teamwork Project Prompt

Find 10 real-world PropTech & Real Estate leads in Shaikpet, Hyderabad, inject them into MongoDB with live Vercel URLs, build 10 bespoke Next.js Tailwind preview sites using subagents, and push everything to GitHub to trigger a Vercel deployment.

Working directory: `d:\GWD\Sales Machine`
Integrity mode: demo

## Requirements

### R1. Lead Discovery & Injection
Research 10 real-world PropTech/Real Estate businesses in Shaikpet, Hyderabad (with working WhatsApp numbers). Push them to the main MongoDB database using a Node.js script. Hardcode the `previewUrl` to `https://yourgwd.vercel.app/client/[slug]`. Generate a custom WhatsApp outreach message referencing their preview URL.

### R2. Bespoke UI Generation
Use the `invoke_subagent` tool to spawn 5 parallel frontend subagents to build 10 distinct, premium Next.js UI preview pages inside `app/client/[slug]`. The subagents MUST strictly read and apply the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill to construct different design systems (Glassmorphism, Neumorphism, Dark Mode, etc.) using Tailwind CSS classes. Ensure the custom `layout.jsx` metadata fix is applied for each so WhatsApp unfurling works correctly.

### R3. Deployment
Verify the Next.js builds. Commit all new files to git and push them to GitHub to trigger the Vercel deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Verification & Quality
- [ ] MongoDB contains 10 new leads for Shaikpet Real Estate with `previewUrl` pointing to `https://yourgwd.vercel.app/client/[slug]`.
- [ ] 10 new folders exist in `app/client/`, each containing a `page.jsx` with extensive Tailwind CSS styling and a `layout.jsx` for custom OpenGraph metadata.
- [ ] Running `npm run build` succeeds with zero errors across the newly generated routes.
- [ ] Changes are successfully pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.
